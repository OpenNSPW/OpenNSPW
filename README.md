# OpenNSPW

OpenNSPW is an open source real-time strategy game written in C# using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/). The original [Naval South Pacific War](http://narashikabranch.web.fc2.com/) (NSPW) was written in the early 2000s by [Tokumizman](https://twitter.com/tokumizman) in C++. This project is a complete rewrite of NSPW from scratch in C#. Some code is based on [NSPW NET Project File Set](https://web.archive.org/web/20090421071927/http://erunst.hp.infoseek.co.jp/), which was available as open source. OpenNSPW is largely influenced by [OpenRA](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA).

The single-player mode is implemented with the use of [Enzan](https://github.com/ycanardeau/Enzan), an x86 emulator.

NOTE: This project is still a work in progress, and many features are yet to be implemented.
